# Number-Systems-Explorer

**Author**: TR FAHIM  
**Language**: Python  

## Overview
**Number-Systems-Explorer** is a Python-based project designed to help users explore and convert between various number systems. It supports operations involving **binary**, **hexadecimal**, **octal**, and **decimal** systems. The project uses functions, the `os` module, and conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to perform its operations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **os**: For handling system-level operations.
- **Control Structures**: `if`, `elif`, `else` for logic implementation.
- Built-in Python methods for handling:
  - **Binary** (`bin`)
  - **Hexadecimal** (`hex`)
  - **Octal** (`oct`)
  - **Decimal** (default integer type).
